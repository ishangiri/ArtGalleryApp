        <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>
        <p>
            Our application collects and uses artist data for the following purposes:<br>
            - Displaying artist information within the application interface.<br>
            - Allowing users to add, update, and delete artist entries.<br>
            - Collected data includes artist names, biographies, and other relevant details.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Data Protection</h2>
        <p>
            To ensure the security of user data, we implement the following measures:<br>
            - Data Integrity: User input is validated to maintain data integrity and prevent unintended data corruption.<br>
            - Authentication and Authorization: While not currently implemented, we are exploring options for managing user sessions and permissions within the application.<br>
            - Data Backup: To mitigate the risk of data loss, we recommend users periodically back up their data using local storage or browser session storage.
        </p>
        <h3>Responsibilities of App Developers</h3>
        <p>
            As the developer of this Angular application, I am committed to safeguarding the privacy of our users. 
            This responsibility extends to all aspects of data collection, usage, and protection within the app.
        </p>
    
        <h3>Data Management</h3>
<p>
    We collect and temporarily store only the data necessary for the functionality of our app. 
    Users are informed about how their data will be used, and we ensure that collected data is stored locally in the user's browser.
    Data is retained only during the user's session, and it is automatically cleared when the user closes the web browser or navigates away from the app.
    We respect user consent and do not store any data about third parties.
</p>

<h3>Securing Data</h3>
<p>
    Data security is a top priority for us, even without a backend or server-side storage. 
    We implement robust security measures to protect user data within the app environment.
    All data stored locally in the user's browser is subject to browser security protocols, ensuring that it is not accessible to unauthorized parties.
    While no data is transmitted over the network or stored on external servers, we still ensure secure handling of user interactions within the app.
